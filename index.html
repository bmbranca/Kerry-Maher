          <h2>I am what I is</h2>
          <p>
            When I was a young actor in North Carolina, driving hours to
            audition for a two-line role in some made-for-TV cheesy drama, I
            dreamed of success complete with money, fame, prestige and clout.
            Eventually, I thought to myself, directors will be begging me to
            accept roles that I would smugly reject as unworthy of an actor of
            my caliber. But at one of these endless auditions, I overheard a
            veteran character actor offer some sage advice to a young actor who
            was arrogantly verbalizing what I had merely contemplated. After
            kindly asking the young man to calm down, he simply told him to
            accept the fact that, “we am what we is.” While the grammar is
            atrocious, is the philosophy is profound and describes perfectly
            where I find myself in my acting career.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the United States I had moderate success as an actor. There were
            a couple of years where I was able to survive solely from acting. I
            acted in probably a hundred commercials, several TV series and a few
            movies. The rest of the time I taught at universities and community
            colleges where an exceptional audition might result in a cancelled
            class or two. Now, I am retired, living in South Korea and surviving
            cancer. And I gleefully accept that “I am what I is.” I’m a 67
            year-old, bald, chubby character actor who is extraordinarily happy
            to not only be acting again, but to be alive.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, if you have a role for someone of my girth, appearance and age,
            I’d love the opportunity to audition for you. Know in advance that
            you will encounter an actor with passion, experience and dedication.
            “I am what I is.”
